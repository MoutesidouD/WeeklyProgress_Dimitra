# You already havee created a repository #
# What else problem are you facing 
you had asked me to post you a piece of code and it couldn't be seen properly here
# There are two ways. When a code snippet is to be shared the best way is to create a gist. 
Let me show you
Then share the link https://gist.github.com/MoutesidouD/fea7ff6cd1abd4edb2ce29a9f7c61b39
DOho you get it? yes thanks a lot! 

The other way is to push to repository. Also You can type in readme file like
```JavaScript
var name = "World";
console.log("Hello",name);
